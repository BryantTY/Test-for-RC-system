# DEPLOYMENT COST

## SC~AMM~ {#scamm .unnumbered}

Mint coin。

We need to mint three types of ERC20 tokens on the BoB now: TK 1, TK 2,
and TK 3. Suppose TK 1 is the native token circulating on BCi; Figures 1
and 2 illustrate the creation process of TK 1. It is evident that a
total of 1,721,468 Gas was consumed to mint a single
token.![](media/image2.png){width="5.768055555555556in"

Figure 2

Thus, we use the same method to mint the three types of tokens, as shown
in Figure 3:

### Create liquidity pool {#create-liquidity-pool .unnumbered}

Assume that TK 2 is a native token circulating on BCj. TK 3 is a
stablecoin circulating on the BoB. Create an AMM contract on BoB and
create three liquidity pool LPS in that AMM contract. As shown in Figure
4 and Figure 5: ![](media/image5.png){width="5.768055555555556in"

Figure 5

It can be seen that deploying an AMM with three LPs costs 1,553,092 Gas.

### Authorization {#authorization .unnumbered}

Then, have the owners of TK 1, TK 2, and TK 3 on the BoB, account 1,
account 2, and account 3, respectively, license right of using a certain
number of tokens to the AMM contract address. Figure 6 shows the process
of the account (0x5b38da6a701c568545dcfcb03fcb875f56beddc4) authorizing
the address (0x878ef18638be2e92dbaeda6260ae0591e6a0154f) of AMM contract
the right to use the tokens with type of TK 1:

height="3.00625in"}

Figure 6

As you can see, the authorization process costs 31,052 Gas.

### Provide liquidity {#provide-liquidity .unnumbered}

Then, a portion of TK 1, TK 2, and TK 3 is placed into the corresponding
three LPs through the AMM contract, as shown in Figure 7:![文本

height="2.640277777777778in"}

Figure 7

As you can see, deploying three LPs costs a total of 266,452 Gas.

### The invocation of exchange rate {#the-invocation-of-exchange-rate .unnumbered}

After the deployment of AMM contract, it can be called to return the
corresponding exchange rate, as shown in Figure 8:

![图形用户界面, 文本
描述已自动生成](media/image9.png){width="5.768055555555556in"
height="1.7868055555555555in"}

Figure 8

As you can see from Figure 8, calling an AMM contract to query the
exchange rate once only costs 17,243 Gas.

Thus, the cost of obtaining the exchange rates in 1 CCTE process is
17,243\*2 Gas.

## Deployment of SC~MPV~ {#deployment-of-scmpv .unnumbered}

Next, we need to deploy the SC~MPV~ contract first, followed by the
SC~D~ contract. This is because the SC~MPV~ contract can call the
function \`*confiscateAndWithdraw\`* in the SC~D~ contract to transfer
the deposited tokens to another account address. Therefore, when
creating the SC~D~ contract, it is necessary to grant such permissions
to the SC~MPV~ contract. The SC~MPV~ contract will be invoked by proof
transactions, thus, it checks two time-related inequalities and verifies
the legality of the Merkle proof included in the proof transactions.
These two valid times include one from the deadline defined in the SC~T~
contract, and another valid time is when two instructions are generated
by the SC~T~ contract. Upon receiving a proof transaction, it is
necessary to verify that the timestamp in the block header included in
the proof transaction is later than the time when the two instructions
were generated by the SC~T~ contract; also, it is required to obtain the
latest local time, which needs to be before the deadline. Therefore,
after these two times are generated by the SC~T~ contract, they need to
be inputted into the SC~MPV~ contract. Consequently, there is a function
in the SC~MPV~ contract that is used to fetch and record these two
times. For security, the input to this function needs to include the
address of the SC~T~ contract, then the function is executed to fetch
these two times from the address of the SC~T~ contract, and store them
in the SC~MPV~ contract.

Legal Merkle proof is stored in the SC~MPV~ contract. When the SC~MPV~
contract stores a second legitimate Merkle proof, the SC~MPV~ contract
emits a complete event.

There is also a trigger function in the SC~MPV~ contract. Any user can
call this trigger function. The premise for using the trigger function
is that, at the deadline, the SC~MPV~ contract has not stored the two
valid Merkle proofs. Once the trigger function is called, the SC~MPV~
contract will check 1) whether it has yet to store two valid Merkle
proofs; 2) whether the current time exceeds the deadline. If both
conditions are met, then the SC~MPV~ contract will invoke the
\`*confiscateAndWithdraw\`* function in the SC~D~ and transfer the
corresponding depositor's TK3 to the designated recipient. The specific
logic for identifying the depositor and the corresponding recipient in
the BoB is based on the two instructions generated in the SCT; each
instruction's sender field contains one address, and each instruction's
receiver field also contains one address. Additionally, it is necessary
to consider the CCT. The CCT is sent to the SCT contract by an address
on the BoB and invokes the \`*executeTransaction*\` function of the SCT
contract. The address sending the CCT corresponds to the address in the
sender field of the sender1instruction in the BoB, and this address has
pledged a portion of TK3 to the SC~D~. Moreover, the CCT includes a
total of five account addresses: the first address participant\[0\] is
the address of sender1 in BCi; the second address participant\[1\] is
the address of sender2 in BCj; the third address participant\[3\] is the
address of receiver1 in BCi; the fourth address participant\[3\] is the
address of receiver2 in BCj; the fifth address participant\[4\] is the
pledging address of sender2 in the BoB.

With this information, the depositor and the corresponding recipient
addresses in the BoB can be clearly identified: For the
sender1instruction, sender1 must use its address in the BoB---the
address that sent the CCT---to send a proof transaction to invoke the
SC~MPV~ contract. Similarly, sender2 must use its address in the
BoB---participant\[4\]---to send a proof transaction to invoke the
SC~MPV~ contract. Therefore, if the proof transaction corresponding to
the address that sent the CCT is not received, the TK3 deposited by the
sending CCT address will be transferred to address participant\[4\]; if
the proof transaction corresponding to address participant\[4\] is not
received, the TK3 deposited by address participant\[4\] will be
transferred to the CCT sending address. Hence, if the trigger function
is correctly activated, it may invoke the *\`confiscateAndWithdraw*\`
function to initiate up to two transfers. As shown in Figure 9,
deploying SCMPV incurred a total cost of 1,271,187 Gas.

### Token transfer  {#token-transfer .unnumbered}

We then had account3 (the holder of the TK3 stablecoin) transfer a
portion of the stablecoin to account1 and account2. Figure 11 shows the
transfer of account3 to account1 tokens, costing a total of 59,963 Gas.

### Authorization {#authorization-1 .unnumbered}

Then, in order for account1 and account2 to pledge their TK3 to SC~D~,

## Connecting SC~MPV~  {#connecting-scmpv .unnumbered}

At this point, all deployment work has been completed, and it is now
necessary to inform SCMPV that the two contracts, SCD and SCT, have been
deployed. The two inform (inherit) operations cost 50,705 50730 Gas in
total), as shown in Figures 16 and 17:

## Total Deployment cost {#total-deployment-cost .unnumbered}

Now, we calculate the total deployment cost: SCAMM spent a total of
1,721,468\*3 Gas (for minting three types of tokens in the BoB) +
1,553,092 Gas (cost of deploying three LPs in SCAMM) + 31,052\*3 Gas
(cost for three authorization operations) + 266,452\*3 Gas (cost of
providing liquidity for three LPs); SCMPV incurred a total of 1,271,187
Gas; SCD spent 2,228,238 Gas (deployment cost) + 59,963\*2 Gas (transfer
costs) + 53,895\*2 Gas (authorization costs) + 222,777\*2 (staking
costs); SCT totalled 1,561,365 Gas. The cost to connect SCMPV with SCD
and SCT is 50,705 + 50,730 Gas. Thus, the final total expenditure is
13,344,068 Gas.

# The operation cost of CCTE 

The CCTE process is now officially open.

## The execution cost of CCT {#the-execution-cost-of-cct .unnumbered}

Firstly, a cross-chain transaction (CCT) is sent to the BoB to invoke
the SC~T~\'s function \`*executeTransaction*\`. According to our design,
the sender of the CCT should be account1
(0x5B38Da6a701c568545dCfcB03FcB875f56beddC4). The CCT includes five
addresses: participant\[0\] is
0xdD870fA1b7C4700F2BD7f44238821C26f7392148, which is sender1's address
on BCi; participant\[1\] is 0x583031D1113aD414F02576BD6afaBfb302140225,
which is sender2's address on BCj; participant\[2\] is
0x4B0897b0513fdC7C541B6d9D7E929C4e5364D2dB, which is receiver1's address
on BCi; participant\[3\] is 0x14723A09ACff6D2A60DcdF7aA4AFf308FDDC160C,
which is receiver2's address on BCj; participant\[4\] is account2
(0xAb8483F64d9C6d1EcF9b849Ae677dD3315835cb2), which is the address of
sender2 in the BoB. Also the two token types involved in the exchange
are specified---TK 1 (0xE5f2A565Ee0Aa9836B4c80a07C8b32aAd7978e22) and TK
2 (0x5802016Bc9976C6f63D6170157adAeA1924586c1), along with the
stablecoin TK 3 (0xa2a7b718Af3CD7F18354Ac5E02235ea6C035BD57), and two
locations (BCi, which is participant\[5\]
(0xCA35b7d915458EF540aDe6068dFe2F44E8fa733c) and BCj which is
participant\[6\] (0x0A098Eda01Ce92ff4A4CCb7A4fFFb5A43EBC70DC)). Assume
sender1 wishes to exchange its TK1 for 22222 units of sender2\'s TK2.
Thus, CCT invokes SCT\'s function \`*executeTransaction*\` as shown in
Figures 18 and 19:\"

## Deployment of SCc {#deployment-of-scc .unnumbered}

### SCc is for validating cross-chain transaction and storing the SD items in valid CCTs. {#scc-is-for-validating-cross-chain-transaction-and-storing-the-sd-items-in-valid-ccts. .unnumbered}

A Cross-chain transaction contains a transaction, a Merkle proof.

Verifying a cross-chain transaction requires verifying a Merkle proof. A
time parameter needs to be validated. If these two validations pass, the
NFT from the transaction in the Cross-chain transaction needs to be
stored in that contract.

(\*\* Because the article assumes that BoB\'s node stores the most
recent k (the secure parameter from common prefix property) block header
of the connected blockchain, when verifying Merkle proof, It is possible
to obtain the block number of the Merkle proof. Therefore, the node
determines whether the block in which the Merkle proof resides has
become stable according to the block number in the latest local block
header.)

As shown in Figure 30，The total cost of deploying the SCc was 1,140,863
Gas.

As shown in Figure 37, we then lock an NFT into the contract for a
period of time (using the lock function in Phase1)![文本
描述已自动生成](media/image38.png){width="5.768055555555556in"
height="2.85625in"}

Figure 37

We then ask the contract to send this NFT to the black hole address when
the unlock time is up (we need to verify that the unlock time has passed
first). As shown in Figure 38, this execution time inequality and the
operator who sends the NFT to the black hole address consumes 114,478
Gas.

![图形用户界面, 文本

height="2.817361111111111in"}

Figure 38

Thus, in Phase 1, a single Lock operation consumes 186,443 Gas. In Phase
2, there are three operations: the first is validating the cross-chain
transaction and storing the legitimate CCT's SD, which consumes 129,780
Gas per execution. The second operation is executing PvP, consuming
63,779 Gas per execution. The third operation is storing the updated
NFT, with each storage consuming 118,645 Gas. In Phase 3, there is one
operation which is validating time inequalities and performing the
\'burn to mint\' operation, consuming 250,307 Gas per execution. In
Phase 4, there are two operations: the first is validating the proof
transaction and storing the legitimate PT's proof, with each operation
consuming 59,700 Gas. The second is deleting the updated SD stored in
Phase 2, consuming 114,478 Gas per operation.

Therefore, assuming there are X SDs, Phase 1 consumes 186,443 \* X Gas;
Phase 2 consumes (129,780 + 118,645) \* X + 63,779 \* X \* (X-1) / 2
Gas; Phase 3 consumes 250,307 \* X Gas; Phase 4 consumes (59,700 +
114,478) \* X Gas.
